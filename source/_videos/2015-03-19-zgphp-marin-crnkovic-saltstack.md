[Marin Crnković](http://blog.anorgan.com/) from [web.burza](http://web.burza.hr/) will 
introduce us to [SaltStack](http://saltstack.com/) - provisioning system that looks to stir some fun in field 
traditionally owned by [Chef](https://www.chef.io/chef/), [Puppet](https://puppetlabs.com/) and 
[Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/home). Enter SaltStack, the remote execution, configuration management system 
that uses YAML files (psst, they are in fact Twig!). This talk will provide a crash course on the basics of Salt 
with some examples and use cases and to get you from "I install my software by hand" to "I used to install by hand, 
but now I love my life".
