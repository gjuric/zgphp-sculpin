### Ivan Habunek - Generators

Not just for electricity, right?

### Ignite session

In Ignite talks, each speakers gets five (5) minutes, and must use twenty (20) slides that are automatically advancing after 15 seconds. So you are forced to get to the point. Pick any topic you like or if you lack inspiration choose something from [Awesome PHP](https://github.com/ziadoz/awesome-php) list.
