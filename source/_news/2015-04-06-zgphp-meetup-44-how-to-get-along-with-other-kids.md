title: ZgPHP Meetup #44: How to get along with other kids
---

Another month, another meetup? Wrong! This one is packed with so much awesome that we can't wait until **April 16th** to 
come to [Mama, Preradoviceva 18](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Preradoviceva+18,+Zagreb,+Croatia/@45.810158,15.974297,17z). 

Since Yii2 was released at the end of 2014 there was plenty of time for [Fatos Hoti](http://www.twitter.com/hotifatos) 
to get to know its dirty little secrets. Together, we will investigate what is new, what is better, what is worse and ž
how to use it all in the real world.

Fatos is developer for over 10 years now, currently employed at [Degordian](http://degordian.com). He loves code and 
everything about it.

Have you heard of ZeroMQ? Do you know what are Request-Reply, Publish-Subscribe or Pipeline patterns? How routing and
transport works? Silvio Marijić, developer from Zagreb and fan of latest and cutting-edge technologies will let you know
more about it.
