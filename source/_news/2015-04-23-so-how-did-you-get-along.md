title: "So, how did you get along?"

We got awesome feedback from one parent that dropped their youngest developer last Thursday.

"ZgPHP user group is nice. Kids behaved. Miro did not bite anyone for not speaking English. 
We might do it again next month."


Announcements
=============
As usual, few quick infos and announcements.

We relaunched our monthly newsletter. [Subscribe and stay in the loop](/newsletter) on what is going on in our user group.

If you feel like chatting with other developers, [drop by our Slack channel](/news/join-us-on-slack-phpsee/).

[GrUSP](https://twitter.com/grusp) is organising their annual [PhpDay 2015 conference](http://2015.phpday.it/) in 
Verona. Speakers and topics are published and tickets are still available! If you are interested in attending 
let us know as they were kind enough to give our user group a discount.

PHP Serbia is once again organising themed conference - [SOLIDay](http://soliday.phpsrbija.rs/). It is so good that 
they already sold all tickets. If you are going, let people know and maybe pick up someone that does not have transport.

No words need to be spent on [Netgen](http://www.netgenlabs.com/), our dear friends and active supporters. 
They are again throwing a tutorial based conferences dedicated to 
[PHP & Symfony](http://2015.phpsummercamp.com/) and [eZ Publish](http://2015.ezsummercamp.com/).
You can expect three days of workshops and one very cool excursion.

group and get a ticket for free!
