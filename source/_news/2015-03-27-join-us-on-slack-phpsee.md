title: Join us on Slack #phpsee
---

One cool initiative from [Andreas Heigl](https://twitter.com/heiglandreas) landed in our inbox few days ago. In short, 
there is a [Slack team for PHP user groups](https://phpug.slack.com/). If you want to join, 
[request an invitation](http://murmuring-forest-7062.herokuapp.com/). Both links are aslo on [php.ug](http://php.ug).
 
You can find a lot of familiar faces at #phpsee channel.
