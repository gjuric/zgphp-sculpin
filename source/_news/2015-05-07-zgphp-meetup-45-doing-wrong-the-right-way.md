OMG!!!eleven is it time for another meetup? Woot, woot! As usual, packed with much awesome, very talks! Come to
[Mama, Preradoviceva 18](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Preradoviceva+18,+Zagreb,+Croatia/@45.810158,15.974297,17z) 
on **May 21st** and hear all about it.

While Behat is meant for behavior driven design, lot of developers started using it as a tool for integration and 
regression testing. In a format understandable not only to developers you can easily test behaviour of your existing 
application (any web app, doesn't have to be written in PHP) utilising different scrapers/crawlers/browsers.

Tired of clicking around your browser to create selenium tests? Your application is heavily dependent on javascript? 
Behat (with help of Mink) can utilize selenium and headless browsers like Firefox or Chrome to verify everything still 
works as expected.

With it's simple domain language, writing down and understanding existing tests is an easy task for both your frontend 
and backend devs but QA too.

Miro Svrtan will take center stage and abuse us for half an hour.

After the break Steve Tauber will talk about building the REST JSON API the right way. This is first part of his talk 
dedicated to this subject so we will focus on RESTful design techniques, the verbs, the nouns and logic in MVC 
environments.
